# Welcome to STAGE 5. IBC Universe.

In Stage 5 we are going to test certain functions related to IBC. For this stage we have partnered with Microtick. 

To give you a broad idea: we will send BCNA & TICK through IBC between 2 different chains, you can learn how to set up your own IBC relayer, and we will utilize BCNA in the Microtick network.

Microtick projectâ€™s goal is to provide a globally agreed upon, real-time consensus price - without requiring direct financial coupling to any underlying asset. 
The project is built on decentralized blockchain technology (Cosmos-SDK). You can learn more here: https://microtick.com/background-information.html
