# Task 2 The basic functionalities of the BitCanna web wallet & Keplr wallet

In the previous task you created a **KEPLR wallet** and connected to the [BitCanna Web wallet](https://testnet-wallet.bitcanna.io/). In this task we'd like to ask you to experiment with all basic functionalities in the web wallet. 

The BitCanna web wallet supports the following functionalities:
* Send transactions
* Receive transactions
* Claim rewards
* Delegate
* Redelegate
* Undelegate
* Vote on proposals
* View current rewards
* View current delegations
* View your transaction history
* View active and inactive validators
* View proposals

You can check the TXs at our [BitCanna Cosmos Explorer](https://testnet-explorer.bitcanna.io/)
